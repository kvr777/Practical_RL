# Homework description

You guessed, two options

### Lasagne option

Follow the [first notebook](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week6.5/char_rnn.ipynb) and implement a simple character-level RNN with pure lasagne. The homework part __(4 points)__ is at the very end of that notebook.

Proceed with [seq2seq](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week6.5/seq2seq.ipynb) notebook for the second part of homework assignment __(6 points)__.

### Alternative

In this assignment, you will need to implement two things __(pts are same)__:
* A generative RNN model for one of datasets below or for your custom dataset (anything from clickbait to pokemon names)
* A conditional generative model for either [formula]->[common_name] task for molecules dataset below or image captioning [or similar custom dataset].

Some helper materials:
* CS231 rnn [assignment](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment3/)
* "Deep models for text and sequences" section of [this course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
