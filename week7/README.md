# Homework

We have a detailed description of the entire lab in the [homework notebook](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week7/7.3_homework.ipynb)

Homework is platform and framewerk independent, so choose the ones which suit you best, but pay attention on how many you will need to implement youself in case of nonstandart ones.
